# nguinet-blog

Steps I've done to get my next.js blog. I choose nextJS for its SSG (Static Site Generation) feature as I though that speed essential for visitors of a blog. 

## Setup the next js app

>npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
>npm run dev    Starts the development server.
>npm run build  Builds the app for production.
>npm start	Runs the built app in production mode.

Create a repo on github (+ License)

>git init
>git add .
>git commit -m "First Commit"
>git remote add origin https://github.com/guinetn/nguinet-blog.git
>git push -u origin main
