Anscombe’s quartet dataset is a great demonstration of why we must use dataviz in parallel with statistical analysis. Moreover python allows to easily get a quick representation of a dataset. The DataSaurus dataset is a kind of "generalization", showing that tinkering data with outliers can make you missed up something if you purely rely on statistics.
