## Making lego car climb obstacles

How to solve mechanical problems with lego
A great lesson of mechanical engineering

1. Construct a Lego car
2. Improving it against obstacles until it becomes a capable climber by considering:
    - wheel diameter
    - gear ratio
    - 4-wheel drive
    - tire grip
    - breakover angle
    - weight distribution

* Base rules for all builds:
    - 4 wheels
    - no steering (to simplify the builds)
    - only Lego parts used

* Remote control
- SBrick https://www.sbrick.com/sbrick.html
- BrickController 2 app (Android) https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...
- PlayStation 4 wireless controller
