								<p>
									My name's Nicolas Guinet, I'm a software engineer with more than 20 years of experience in a variety of domains. I enjoy creating things for the web or to improve backend/desktop app's performance.
									<br/>This blog is intended to be about technology, science, programming and all stuff related to a scientist developer journeys in a broad sense. 
									<br />During my career, I've written software in many languages, and I'm the most proficient in C#, C, NodeJS, Python and recently playing with Go and Rust. I though the mix wasm/wasmedge + rust + microservices is the next step in development so, as a constant learner, I stay focused on that ecosystem. I aslo take time to train me some IA (Tensorflow/Python/R) projects.
									<br /> I‚Äôve had the privilege of working for a lot of great companies: Axa IM, Suez, Thales, Kepler Equities, Dexia, Rockwool and many smaller entities.
									<br /><br />I'm French, living at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a city near from Paris. A lot of my own work is Open Source software, and you can find it on this website and github. I create this blog (with NextJS) as I enjoy sharing my learning, be on this blog or Twitter.
									<br/>I would be happy if you connect with me on social media.
